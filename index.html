        <h2>What is Active Learning?</h2>
        <p>Active learning is a method of instruction that actively engages students in the learning process, making them participants rather than passive listeners. This approach can include reading, writing, discussion, or problem-solving that promotes analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of class content.</p>
